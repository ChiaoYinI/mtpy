                The never-ending ToDo list for MTpy
                ===================================


________
--------
GENERAL:
________
--------


- Documentation!
- Example data set
- Test cases
- Commenting!!
(- Doc strings!!)
- test on Windows
- Documentation:
  + mention unparsable dates due tu US style ambiguity
  + Edi.writefile writes only info_dict...all info stuff from string has to be put in there manually


______
 CORE (handling of Edi files and resulting Z objects)
------

-edi: take  z and tipper attributes as objects!!
-edi: check definemeas entries, if they are necessary
-edi: remove n_freqs entry
-edi: Values are not Nulled, when a new file is read in 
edi: get rid of 'filename' when initialising the object
-Z: remove edi_object
-Z: remove imag/real
Z: rotation angle list of proper length - AND check,k if updated with angles from parent edi object
-Z: rename rho_phi into res_phase
- bscale factor not necessary
- test reading of EDI for various Edi file versions
- Include W for the analysis of GDS data


__________
 ANALYSIS (everything operating on frequency domain based data, e.g. Edi and Z)
----------

- add static shift handling (automated, if possible)


_________
 IMAGING (no comment)
---------

- ALL 
(if possible by setting up plot classes for the respective elements - rather than batch processing (plotting various stations can be handled by functions looping over the plot objects ...??)

__________
 MODELING (wrapper for calling external modelling tools, functions for converting in- and outputs)
----------

- ALL (introduce MODEL classes for all supported modelling codes, then handle calling as well as in- and output)


____________
 PROCESSING (everything operating on time series)
------------

- batch processing (various stations, whole folders)
- extended BIRRP usage
- Birrp: keep temporary birrp files for later reprocessing (needs to store meta data for that)
- implement call of EMTF (Egbert's BIRRP alternative)
- time frequency analysis
- quality check
-calibrate: mandatory entry for B-field sensor: X/Y axis orientation angle & Declination angle for geomag correction



_______
 UTILS (handy general things like concatenation and renaming of files, unit and data type conversions, standard calculations)
-------

- extend filehandling (more automated batch processing)
- decimate
- type-conversion (e.g. coordinate formats)
- data conversion in general
- miniSeed
- MetaData handling: convert *.XLS to *.cfg

______
 TEST (unit tests for all the functions)
------

- ALL
