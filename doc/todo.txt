                The never-ending ToDo list for MTpy
                ===================================


________
--------
GENERAL:
________
--------


- Documentation!
- Example data set
- Test cases
- Commenting!!
(- Doc strings!!)
- test on Windows


______
 CORE (handling of Edi files and resulting Z objects)
------

- test reading of EDI for various Edi file versions
- Include W for the analysis of GDS data


__________
 ANALYSIS (everything operating on frequency domain based data, e.g. Edi and Z)
----------

- add static shift handling (automated, if possible)


_________
 IMAGING (no comment)
---------

- ALL 
(if possible by setting up plot classes for the respective elements - rather than batch processing (plotting various stations can be handled by functions looping over the plot objects ...??)

__________
 MODELING (wrapper for calling external modelling tools, functions for converting in- and outputs)
----------

- ALL (introduce MODEL classes for all supported modelling codes, then handle calling as well as in- and output)


____________
 PROCESSING (everything operating on time series)
------------

- batch processing (various stations, whole folders)
- extended BIRRP usage
- implement call of EMTF (Egbert's BIRRP alternative)
- time frequency analysis
- quality check


_______
 UTILS (handy general things like concatenation and renaming of files, unit and data type conversions, standard calculations)
-------

- extend filehandling (more automated batch processing)
- decimate
- type-conversion (e.g. coordinate formats)
- data conversion in general
- miniSeed
- MetaData handling: convert *.XLS to *.cfg

______
 TEST (unit tests for all the functions)
------

- ALL
