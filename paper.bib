abstract = {The phase relationships contained in the magnetotelluric (MT) impedance tensor are shown to be a second-rank tensor. This tensor expresses how the phase relationships change with polarization in the general case where the conductivity structure is 3-D. Where galvanic effects produced by heterogeneities in near-surface conductivity distort the regional MT response the phase tensor preserves the regional phase information. Calculation of the phase tensor requires no assumption about the dimensionality of the underlying conductivity distribution and is applicable where both the heterogeneity and regional structure are 3-D. For 1-D regional conductivity structures, the phase tensor is characterized by a single coordinate invariant phase equal to the 1-D impedance tensor phase. If the regional conductivity structure is 2-D, the phase tensor is symmetric with one of its principal axes aligned parallel to the strike axis of the regional structure. In the 2-D case, the principal values (coordinate invariants) of the phase tensor are the transverse electric and magnetic polarization phases. The orientation of the phase tensor's principal axes can be determined directly from the impedance tensor components in both 2-D and 3-D situations. In the 3-D case, the phase tensor is non-symmetric and has a third coordinate invariant that is a distortion-free measure of the asymmetry of the regional MT response. The phase tensor can be depicted graphically as an ellipse, the major and minor axes representing the principal axes of the tensor. 3-D model studies show that the orientations of the phase tensor principal axes reflect lateral variations (gradients) in the underlying regional conductivity structure. Maps of the phase tensor ellipses provide a method of visualizing this variation.},

abstract = {Magnetotelluric (MT) data are inverted for smooth 2-D models using an extension of the existing 1-D algorithm, Occam's inversion. Since an MT data set consists of a finite number of imprecise data, an infinity of solutions to the inverse problem exists. Fitting field or synthetic electromagnetic data as closely as possible results in theoretical models with a maximum amount of roughness, or structure. However, by relaxing the misfit criterion only a small amount, models which are maximally smooth may be generated. Smooth models are less likely to result in overinterpretation of the data and reflect the true resolving power of the MT method. The models are composed of a large number of rectangular prisms, each having a constant conductivity. Apriori information, in the form of boundary locations only or both boundary locations and conductivity, may be included, providing a powerful tool for improving the resolving power of the data.

abstract = {The Jacobian of the non-linear mapping from model parameters to observations is a key component in all gradient-based inversion methods, including variants on Gauss–Newton and non-linear conjugate gradients. Here, we develop a general mathematical framework for Jacobian computations arising in electromagnetic (EM) geophysical inverse problems. Our analysis, which is based on the discrete formulation of the forward problem, divides computations into components (data functionals, forward and adjoint solvers, model parameter mappings), and clarifies dependencies among these elements within realistic numerical inversion codes. To be concrete, we focus much of the specific discussion on 2-D and 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) inverse problems, but our analysis is applicable to a wide range of active and passive source EM methods. The general theory developed here provides the basis for development of a modular system of computer codes for inversion of EM geophysical data, which we summarize at the end of the paper.},

The system is constructed with a fine level of modular granularity, with basic components of the inversion - forward modeling, sensitivity computations, inversion search algorithms, model parametrization and regularization, data functionals - interchangeable, reusable and readily extensible. Modular sensitivity computations and generic interfaces to parallelized inversion algorithms provide a ready framework for rapid implementation of new applications or inversion algorithms. We illustrate the code[U+05F3]s versatility and capabilities for code reuse through implementation of 3D magnetotelluric (MT) and controlled-source EM (CSEM) inversions, using essentially the same components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present the software package MTpy that allows handling, processing, and imaging of magnetotelluric (MT) data sets. Written in Python, the code is open source, containing sub-packages and modules for various tasks within the standard MT data processing and handling scheme. Besides the independent definition of classes and functions, MTpy provides wrappers and convenience scripts to call standard external data processing and modelling software. In its current state, modules and functions of MTpy work on raw and pre-processed MT data. However, opposite to providing a static compilation of software, we prefer to introduce MTpy as a flexible software toolbox, whose contents can be combined and utilised according to the respective needs of the user. Just as the overall functionality of a mechanical toolbox can be extended by adding new tools, MTpy is a flexible framework, which will be dynamically extended in the future. Furthermore, it can help to unify and extend existing codes and algorithms within the (academic) MT community. In this paper, we introduce the structure and concept of MTpy. Additionally, we show some examples from an everyday work-flow of MT data processing: the generation of standard EDI data files from raw electric (E-) and magnetic flux density (B-) field time series as input, the conversion into MiniSEED data format, as well as the generation of a graphical data representation in the form of a Phase Tensor pseudosection.},
